**Welcome to the ultimate ramen quest!**  
In this Naruto-inspired version of the **So_Long** project, our favorite ninja, **Naruto Uzumaki**, is on a mission to collect coins and satisfy his never-ending hunger for ramen at **Ichiraku Ramen**—the only place worthy of his cravings. Get ready to code, laugh, and believe it!

## 🌀 Why So_Long?  
The **So_Long** project is part of 42’s curriculum, challenging you to build a 2D game using the **MinilibX** library. But why stop at basic mechanics when you can add ninja flair? With Naruto at the helm, this game becomes more than code—it's a ramen-powered adventure!

## 🍥 Features That'll Make Jiraiya Proud  

### 🍜 Map Rendering  
Load beautifully handcrafted `.ber` maps featuring walls (don't ninja-parkour into them!), coins (Naruto’s currency for ramen), and the legendary **Ichiraku Ramen** as the ultimate goal.  

### 💨 Player Movement  
Help Naruto dash through the map with WASD controls! Up, down, left, right—just don’t fall into the void or embarrass yourself in front of Sasuke.  

### ⚡ Collision Detection  
No walking through walls, ninja magic or not. If Naruto hits an obstacle, it’s time to rethink that ninja strategy.  

### 💰 Item Collection  
Coins are life—or rather, ramen is life, and coins pay for ramen. Collect them all to unlock a steaming bowl of Ichiraku's finest.  

### 🏆 Win Condition  
Once all the coins are collected, Naruto earns the right to chow down. Skip any coins, and Teuchi (the ramen master) might ban you for life. **No coins, no noodles.**

## 🍥 Naruto in a Nutshell  
Naruto Uzumaki is the ultimate underdog—a loud, determined ninja with dreams of becoming Hokage. When he’s not mastering jutsu or fighting epic battles, he’s devouring bowls of ramen at Ichiraku. His journey is packed with laughs, tears, and way too much “dattebayo!”  

**Fun fact**: If Naruto could code, he’d debug with Shadow Clones.

## 🎮 Why You'll Love This Game  
This isn’t just a coding project; it’s your chance to immerse yourself in the ninja world, hone your skills, and create a game that’s as fun to play as it is to make. Plus, it’s an excuse to rewatch Naruto and call it “research.”

## 🍜 So, Ready to Code Like a Hokage?  
Build the game, guide Naruto to ramen glory, and remember—every line of code brings you closer to Ichiraku! **Believe it!**
